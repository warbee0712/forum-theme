## Contributing

We have [separate branches](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/discourse-theme/branches) for dark and light color schemes. You should make fixes and make pull requests against these indiviually for them to work on the variants. These branches are intentionally orphaned to prevent any conflicts. You should make changes on each branch that you want to fix separately.

All pull requests against the master branch will be closed, its a document only branch.

You can learn more about themes in this comprehensive article: https://meta.discourse.org/t/developer-s-guide-to-discourse-themes/93648

> Note: The theme plugins (our own and third party) have their own repositories.
