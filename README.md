## Contributing

We have [separate branches](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/discourse-theme/branches) for dark and light color schemes.

You should make fixes and make pull requests against these indiviually for them to work on the variants.

All pull requests against the master branch will be closed, because its a document only branch.

Note: The theme plugins (our own and third party) have their own repositories.
